### Who runs SISTEM?

Redbrick, DUCSS an DU Netsoc have joined this year to bring you SISTEM, a meetup
style event ran by students, for students. The people behind SISTEM are just
like the majority of it's attendees - students!

### What does SISTEM mean?

SISTEM is and acronym for the Students Inter Society Tech & Enterprise Meetup.
It's pretty self explanatory, we provide a link between Students and those in
the world of Tech and Enterprise in a casual meetup environment.

### How did SISTEM come about?

SISTEM was born from the minds of students who love networking, conference
styled meetups and all things tech. The societies behind SISTEM recognised that
there is no event in Ireland targets topic in a way that doesn't go above most
students' heads. A lot of the material at conferences across the country is
usually geared towards the graduates rather than the undergraduates. SISTEM is
ran by a team of undergraduates, so we know what this can feel like. It can be
alienating and rather off putting. Now with this said, there's many amazing
conferences, meetups and summits nationwide. We take inspiration from such
things, without them, this gathering of minds would not have been. In our
opinion, these conferences fail to engage third-level students the way we hope
to. We recognise that today's undergraduates are tomorrows graduates, so they
more than deserve something that's on their level.
