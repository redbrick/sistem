### What is SISTEM and what does it mean?

SISTEM is and acronym for the Students Inter Society Tech & Enterprise Meetup.
It's pretty self explanatory, we provide a link between Students and those in
the world of Tech and Enterprise in a casual meetup environment.

### Why

SISTEM was born from the minds of students who love networking,
conference-styled meetups and all things tech. The societies behind SISTEM are
Redbrick, DIT Compsoc, DUCSS, and DU Netsoc. They recognised that there is no
event in Ireland targets topic in a way that doesn't go above most students'
heads.

A lot of the material at conferences across the country is usually geared
towards the graduates rather than the undergraduates. SISTEM is run by a team of
undergraduates, so we know what this can feel like. It can be alienating and
rather off putting.

### When and Where

We are holding the conference on the 24th of March 2018. This is a Saturday and
we feel it as a perfect time during the second semester of academic study for
such an event to be held.
