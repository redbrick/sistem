### What does SISTEM mean?

SISTEM is and acronym for the Students Inter Society Tech & Enterprise Meetup.
It's pretty self explanatory, we provide a link between Students and those in
the world of Tech and Enterprise in a casual meetup environment.

### Why (some nice waffle)

SISTEM was born from the minds of students who love networking, conference
styled meetups and all things tech. The societies behind SISTEM are DUCSS,
Redbrick, DIT Compsoc and DU Netsoc. They recognised that there is no event in
Ireland targets topic in a way that doesn't go above most students' heads.

A lot of the material at conferences across the country is usually geared
towards the graduates rather than the undergraduates. SISTEM is ran by a team of
undergraduates, so we know what this can feel like. It can be alienating and
rather off putting.

### When and Where

We hope to hold the conference on the 24th of March 2018. This is a Saturday and
we feel it as a perfect time during the second semester of academic study for
such an event to be held.

### Speakers/Workshops

We currently have some speakers and workshops organised and we are looking for
more. We are interested in many different areas but we'd preferable like talks
and workshops that don't go too far over the heads of students.
