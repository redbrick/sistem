### Who should write a proposal?

Everyone and anyone can write a proposal for SISTEM! We need people of all
skills levels, be that beginner, intermediate, or advanced, as students
themselves range from being novices to experts. The community of Irish computing
students is comprised of all skills levels, and it's only right that SISTEM
reflects this fact.

### When should you write a proposal?

As soon as possible! The sooner you've written a proposal, the sooner you can
submit it! We review proposals as soon as they are entered. We only have a
certain number of slots still free, so get your proposals in as soon as you can!
The deadline is 18:00 on the 31st of January 2018. After this we won't be able
to review anymore proposals as we will be in the process of further organisation
for the day.

### Where should you submit your proposal?
